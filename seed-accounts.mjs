Exact visual style to emulate (invent fresh ${niche.name} facts, never copy verbatim):
${example}

Rules: 100% Markdown, plain flowing body. Use only safe inline styling — **bold** (1-2 key words max, never a whole line), *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, "- " lists, and | tables | when asked. NEVER use container blocks: no blockquotes (>) and no \`\`\`text code fences — write everything as plain paragraphs and lists. NEVER repeat the hook text anywhere in the body; the body must add new information, not echo the title. No emojis, no emoticons, text + numbers only, symbols (× = ≠ ↓) only where meaningful. Every line short enough for one screen. Claims must be factually correct for the niche — no hype, no misleading numbers.`;
