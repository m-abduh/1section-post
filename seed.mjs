// Seed categories: one entry = a financial content format + the prompt that
// steers the AI to produce that format as GitHub-README-style Markdown.
//
// The renderer composes the final one-screen slide as:
//   # {nn} — {Category}
//   ---
//   ## {hook}      <- the headline/hook, written by the AI
//   {body}         <- the rest, written by the AI (this is what the prompt steers)
//
// Body rules for EVERY category (baked into each prompt below):
// - Plain flowing Markdown: **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, "- " lists,
//   and | tables | where the format calls for them.
// - NEVER use container blocks: no blockquotes (>) and no \`\`\`text code fences.
// - NEVER repeat the hook text anywhere in the body — the body must stand on its
//   own as a separate, non-redundant discussion (no wasted vertical space).
// - The hook may use inline styling (like **bold**) SPARINGLY on a key phrase,
//   but never bold the whole hook.
// - NEVER use emojis or emoticons — only text and numbers; use symbols
//   (× = ≠ ↓) ONLY when they carry meaning.
// - Keep lines short enough to fit on one 1080x1350 static frame.
// - Every claim must be financially/factually correct — no hype.

function readmeBody({ structure, example }) {
  return `Write the CONTENT BODY in plain, flowing Markdown. A headline (the "hook") already sits above as the H2 title; your body is everything after it — pure Markdown that renders beautifully on ONE static slide.

Structure to follow:
${structure}

Exact visual style to emulate (invent fresh content, never copy verbatim):
${example}

Rules: 100% Markdown, plain flowing body. Use only safe inline styling — **bold** (1-2 key words max, never a whole line), *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, "- " lists, and | tables | when asked. NEVER use container blocks: no blockquotes (>) and no \`\`\`text code fences — write everything as plain paragraphs and lists. NEVER repeat the hook text anywhere in the body; the body must add new information, not echo the title. No emojis, no emoticons, text + numbers only, symbols (× = ≠ ↓) only where meaningful. Every line short enough for one screen. Correct financial theory and accurate numbers.`;
